<b>HOW DID WE DEVELOP SUCH A SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT TOOL FOR LEARNING ENGLISH FROM SCRATCH?</b>

<b>1.</b> We've developed an accessible and effective <b><u>GRAMMAR COURSE</u></b> for all-level learners.  English grammar can be confusing and overwhelming. Good news: we've done all the hard work for you. We took the most essential and relevant grammar and broke it down into bite-sized topics complete with drills. Each topic is a simple rule or structure, which comes with an instant comprehension check. With this system you can learn English grammar from the basics, all by yourself.

<b>2.</b>We've created an improved <b><u>FLASHCARD LIBRARY</u></b> for more effective word learning. Each flashcard has a sentence which helps memorize the word using associations. The app uses <b>spaced repetition</b> to help you remember every word. Expand your vocabulary fast with Simpler. 

<b>3.</b> At Simpler we know the importance of <b>listening skills</b> and learning the correct pronunciation from the very beginning. That's why every phrase in our exercises is voiced by a native speaker. And in our <b><u>PRACTICE</u></b> section you can put new grammar and vocabulary to use and role play one of the two speakers in a real-life dialogue.  

<b>4.</b> <u><b>DRILLS</b></u> are one of the key elements of our course. These are grammar exercises, such as completing a sentence or typing in the translation of a phrase. The drills train you to formulate correct sentences and use new grammar without even thinking about it. Some of the previously learned grammar is regularly added to your drills to keep your memory strong. We use various types of exercises in our drills to maximize the efficiency and make them fun. 

<b>5.</b> <b>Practice makes perfect.</b> You can select <u><b>RAPID PACE</b></u> and set your DAILY GOAL for extra motivation. Practice regularly and see the effects within a week!  

<b>7.</b> <u><b>A UNIQUE FEATURE</b></u>: Enjoy thrilling detective stories adapted for English learners! Learn new words and phrases and start thinking in English as you solve crimes and mysteries.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the English language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of English grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn English phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right English pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your English words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak English clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning English. Mondly teaches you English vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational English.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core English vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak English clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the English verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning English is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these English lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","Learn English with free lessons daily.

If you ever feel frustrated because you do not understand fast-speaking natives, you forget new expressions, you freeze up in conversation (not knowing the right word), or you do not feel confident and natural speaking, then download RealLife English now! Just look how it helped this learner:

""…my English isn't perfect… but the app has really helped me to build up my vocabulary. Sometimes I'm having conversations with my colleagues who are natives. When I listen to a word that I learned using the app, I just feel really, really happy because I'm making improvements. It also helped me to improve my pronunciation…. specifically, about the connected speech and how I should pronounce it. I'm trying to focus my efforts on that. I feel like I'm going to achieve my goals if I continue using the app.” (Daniel G. 🇲🇽)

Most classes and apps promise you fluency in months, but then do not prepare you for real-life, everyday situations. You’re left stuck, your English does not flow.

–Always remember the right word at the right time

1. 👂🏼LEARN—We have a huge variety of FUN real-life conversation videos where you’ll learn English you’ll actually use in your everyday life, while developing your listening to understand fast-native speech and vocabulary
2. 🧠 PRACTICE—Watching each lesson, you will unlock Vocabulary Flashcards with the new advanced expressions that you need for your life. These use innovative technology that helps you never forget the new expressions
3. 🗣️ SPEAK—Actually use your English and discover other cultures in conversations with real people from around the world in the Global Speak. It’s okay if you are shy. The first two steps will help you build your confidence and develop the skills to communicate naturally in any situation without fear or mistakes. Take your time.

Learn Spanish. Speak Spanish,"<b>Speak Spanish faster</b> than you ever imagined with Mondly’s proprietary ILA-method. How? The secret is to make it simple. Have you ever heard a song in the radio which had you bopping your head and wanting to sing along? 

<b>The first step of learning Spanish</b> is pretty similar. You listen to the sound of native Spanish speakers and repeat some of their words.

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Spanish words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly gives you the confidence to speak Spanish. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly offers you.

<b>We all learn in different ways so here are some of the other highlights Mondly offers:</b>
• Well-structured grammar drills which integrate seamlessly into the content of the lessons
• Verb conjugations to show you the underlining structure and further boost your confidence
• Reading and writing games to complete your skills and give you full independence

So what does the ILA-Method stand for? It’s Immersive Language Acquisition and it means with Mondly you pick up Spanish in the most natural way possible. But don’t trust the over 50 million users who have given the app a 4.7/5.0 rating. 

<b>Here’s what the press had to say:</b>

» “The new and sexier way to learn languages” - Huffington Post
» “Closest thing to actual immersion” - TNW

LearnSpanish for Kids Game App,"Stop wasting your time with apps that help you ""memorize better""! Forget flashcards and vocabulary drills, they just don't work. That's because language that sticks is not memorized - it is absorbed. With FabuLingua, kids absorb Spanish naturally - through stories they can understand.  

FabuLingua is ""a leader in game-based learning"" (according to ""Clever"", the educational platform that hosts most educational applications). To kids FabuLingua is a FUN mobile game - a game of adventure where their progress in playing through beautiful interactive stories helps them discover new beautiful secret locations, earning gold and diamond keys that unlock treasure chests full of bounty! 

Under the hood of this engaging game, however, there is a ton of learning science!  FabuLingua's story-based, patented method is rooted in the latest science of second language acquisition and develops excellent pronunciation. It is so effective it has won many awards by language-learning and education experts.

Parents love FabuLingua because it's designed for independent learning - parents don't need to speak any Spanish themselves. Families can create up to 6 individual child profiles under one $69.99/year subscription, making it ideal and affordable for siblings or multi-age homeschool settings.

WINNER of the 2025 ""Top Language Learning Mobile Game & App"" award by Educational Technology insights.

PARENT PICKS AWARD 2025 for ""Best Educational Products in the World"" and ""Best Products for Elementary Kids

Main Features:

• “Play to Learn” - An interactive, story-based mobile game to engage kids and learn Spanish.
• An adaptive learning path that develops progressive language skills - comprehension, pronunciation, grammar, and literacy.
• Science-backed “Magical Translations” learning method based on “comprehensible input.”
• A growing collection of beautiful, interactive language-learning stories.
• Fun free play and games that reinforce knowledge.
• A free reward system that incentivizes and motivates learning.
• Audio recording mode that allows the child to practice pronunciation and develop reading skills.
• Unique playing cards and free collectible digital stickers.
• New features for stories and games that are added regularly like Leaderboards, Stickerbook, Avatar system, Achievement Badges, Quests, Card Battler
• Parental controls and progress tracking.
• MAGICAL TRANSLATIONS- An innovative way to teach Spanish to kids:
Through our Magical Translations™ method, children see only the Spanish text but hear the narrator’s rhythmic (and strategically timed) alternation between Spanish and English translation. Our method is supported by Dr. Stephen Krashen’s Comprehensible Input Hypothesis. Simply put, “comprehensible input” is new-language input that can be comprehended by listeners despite them not understanding all the words. When kids learn Spanish through comprehensible input they absorb it instead of memorizing it. And that leads to language that sticks.

With FabuLingua Kids absorb Spanish through Stories they can understand.  They come to life in a fun Mobile Game.  It’s natural, effortless and backed by science.","Stop wasting your time with apps that help you &quot;memorize better&quot;!

renshuu - Japanese learning,"A cute, ad-free, and enjoyable learning experience is waiting for you in the Renshuu community! The free version is unlimited: there’s no timer before you are forced to pay!

★ A path for every learning style and every goal ★
Whether you are getting started with the alphabets or have been studying for years, jump in exactly where you belong! Don’t waste time going through what you already know. 

Renshuu maintains learning paths for most textbooks, the JLPT, Kanji Kentei, and for those who just want to learn. You can also carve out your own path! Our community has over 10,000 user-made lessons for even more focused learning.

★ Cute, relaxing, and fun ★
Our mascot Kao-chan is here to let you enjoy learning Japanese, whether it’s through collectible coins every time you quiz, a character that evolves as you learn, manga pages that you unlock, or hundreds of hand-made illustrations.  

Additionally, we have both single and multiplayer games to help you keep your learning and reviewing fresh! 

★ Personal service ★ 
We are just a two-person company - and we don’t use chat bots. That means that every question you have gets an answer directly from us.  

★ Rich, in-depth materials ★
■ Vocabulary: over 15,000 native-recorded audio files, 17,000 hand-picked images, and 160,000 example sentences make understanding vocabulary a breeze. Our growing library of accent/pitch data can even help you with accent reduction.
■ Kanji: 12,000+ kanji, with no limits on what you can study! Over 2,000 colorful mnemonics help you to understand and retain the meanings.
■ Grammar: Over 800 different expressions, each complete with native-written model sentences, construction diagrams, audio, and over 7,500 hand-made quiz questions. 
■ Sentences: Thousands of sentences complete with audio, divided by theme and difficulty levels.

★ A superior quiz system designed around Japanese ★
Our SRS-for-Japanese system doesn’t treat Japanese materials like flashcards to be memorized, and breaks every item down into individual components so you can understand, and not just memorize. Mastery schedules keep you studying only what you need to, pushing weaker materials to the front for you to focus on.

Dozens of different question styles keep things fresh, while a flexible input system (multiple choice, typing, or writing) lets you answer the way that you want to.

★ Customizable down to the last character ★ 
Renshuu doesn’t believe that there is a single way of studying that everyone should adhere to. Our expansive settings and customizations let you adjust the learning environment to what works best for you.","A cute, ad-free, and enjoyable learning experience is waiting for you in the Renshuu community!

Learn Japanese. Speak Japanese,"<b>Speak Japanese faster</b> than you ever imagined with Mondly’s proprietary ILA-method. How? The secret is to make it simple. Have you ever heard a song in the radio which had you bopping your head and wanting to sing along? 

<b>The first step of learning Japanese</b> is pretty similar. You listen to the sound of native Japanese speakers and repeat some of their words.

Mondly’s state-of-the-art speech recognition shows you how well you already speak and where you can improve. It’s fun and doesn’t even feel like learning. Especially because Mondly by Pearson uses your mother language so you never get lost in translation.

<b>The second step is even easier</b>. Take a break. Your lesson is never more than 9 minutes long and here is why: Your brain needs a rest to store the new information. And while you’re busy with your life, Japanese words and sentences get anchored in your long-term memory.

<b>The result:</b> You find yourself effortlessly knowing what to say and when. Don’t worry about the exact timing. Mondly by Pearson gives you control over the entire process. You receive friendly reminders exactly when your brain is set for the next dose of knowledge.

<b>The third step is all about you.</b> Because now you’re ready to create your own phrases and adding your individual touch and personality back into the conversation. And when you want to practice, Mondly’s interactive chat-bot becomes your pocket tutor. 

There are over 40 practical, real-life situations which take you to the restaurant, shopping, exploring the city and many more.
But that’s not the only reason why Mondly by Pearson gives you the confidence to speak Japanese. Because the HandsFree mode lets you practice without looking at the screen. Just connect your headphones and you’re in Paris, chatting away with the locals.

<b>Need a quick boost of motivation?</b> Check your progress with the advanced statistics and intelligent reporting. It shows you how far you have come in your journey to master the 5,000 words and phrases Mondly by Pearson offers you.

<b>We all learn in different ways so here are some of the other highlights Mondly by Pearson offers:</b>
• Well-structured grammar drills which integrate seamlessly into the content of the lessons
• Verb conjugations to show you the underlining structure and further boost your confidence
• Reading and writing games to complete your skills and give you full independence

So what does the ILA-Method stand for? It’s Immersive Language Acquisition and it means with Mondly by Pearson you pick up Japanese in the most natural way possible. But don’t trust the over 100 million users who have given the app a 4.7/5.0 rating.

Shinobi: Read & Learn Japanese,"Shinobi: Read & Learn Japanese is the first reading-focused app that lets you grow from absolute beginner (below JLPT N5) all the way to JLPT N1—and beyond—through richly illustrated graded stories, daily easy news, and smart review tools. Instead of memorising lists, you absorb vocabulary, kanji and grammar together, in context.

<b>What makes Shinobi different ?</b>

• <b>Graded illustrated stories</b> – Hundreds of short, level-tagged stories written by native Japanese teachers. Art, dialog and narration evolve as your level rises, keeping difficulty just right.
• <b> Daily easy news</b>  – Follow Japanese news with bite-sized articles rewritten for learners; expand your vocabulary while exploring fresh topics every day.
• <b> Multi-input immersion</b>  – Each page combines images, audio and clean text. Seeing, hearing and reading at once builds natural comprehension.
•  <b>Think-in-Japanese approach</b>  – Inline hints keep you inside the language; you understand meaning without bouncing back to your native tongue, training real-time thinking skills.
• <b> Smart review built in</b>  – Tap any word or kanji to save it; spaced-repetition decks surface items just before you forget them, so knowledge sticks effortlessly.
•  <b>Kanji, grammar and vocab together</b>  – No need for separate apps: stories show how kanji, sentence patterns and new words work side-by-side inside a real story.
•  <b>Adaptive progression</b>  – Toggle Furigana on and Off, hide specific furigana and bookmarks important words.

 <b>Why it works

Context-first learning reinforces memory through storyline, visuals and sound.

Micro-chapters (5-20 pages) fit busy schedules and build daily momentum.

Gamified XP and streaks keep motivation high without gimmicks.

Comprehensive coverage means one app for reading, listening and review.

KanjiKen - Learn Japanese,"Learn Japanese with KanjiKen!

KanjiKen takes you all the way from being a complete beginner to knowing Hiragana, Katakana, and all the 2000+ Kanji characters required to be able to read Japanese! Along the way, you will also discover more than 2000 of the most common Japanese words, sorted by real-world usage data, and unlocked once you know the relevant characters. Learn Hiragana, Katakana, Kanji, and Vocabulary, all in one place with KanjiKen!

--- Info ---

KanjiKen (漢字剣 - lit. Kanji Sword) is here to help you learn Japanese!

Based on real Japanese language usage data, KanjiKen teaches the most common characters and words first. Learn how kanji characters are built and depend on each other, by puzzling together their sub-components by placing the components in the right place. Learn how to pronounce them with common word examples. Practice Hiragana and Katakana with the reading exercises.

KanjiKen offers a complete Kanji and Vocabulary list with a single button press. Don't worry about learning order or what to repeat next, KanjiKen got you covered! With a built-in spaced repetition system (SRS), KanjiKen prioritizes the exercises you struggle with most and helps you memorize and review the exercises effectively. If you get something wrong, the exercise will show up more. If you get a certain exercise right, it will show up less and less, before getting marked as learned and removed from your learning queue.

Study whenever you want. Unlike other apps, KanjiKen will never ask you to commit to unreasonable tasks, like doing hundreds of reviews on a single day. KanjiKen simply asks you to set a achivable time commitment, and helps you keep on track with a streak system and notifications. KanjiKen adapts to you, not the other way around.

--- Usage ---

KanjiKen is designed to be used in short sessions. Set a daily goal, anything between 1 and 30 minutes, and fill your daily quota while waiting for the bus, during downtime, or during a lunch break. A session is over if you hit your daily goal or make too many mistakes. But don't worry! You can start a new session after the time-out period of 30 minutes is over. Hit your daily goal and have some extra time? Just dismiss your daily goal and keep going!

--- Premium ---

Do you want to support further development of KanjiKen?

With KanjiKen Premium you will not only help out the developer but also gain unlimited hearts. Study how long you want, when you want, completely ad-free and without worrying about mistakes.

Natural and Intuitive Way to Learn Spoken Chinese

The Serial Course contains months worth of content and is designed to take you from absolute beginner all the way to intermediate level. It starts out with extremely simple sentences and gently builds on that, only introducing new material very gradually. The content is carefully designed so that you are never confronted with a word you don't know. The aim of the course is to give you the essential building blocks for forming practical sentences of your own. It naturally integrates spaced repetition so that as you move forward you are continually revising previous content.

Powerful Revision Features

Research into language acquisition has shown that repetition of comprehensible content is one of the most effective ways of learning a language. Repetition Training is a core feature of Immersive Chinese that allows you to play a specific selection of content on a continuous loop according to a number of different settings. You can set the specific time delay before and after each sentence, use normal speed or slow recordings, repeat each sentence a certain number of times, and use a random or sequential order. You can also add custom filters, so you only study the exact material you want to.

The Mandarin Training Center (MTC) was founded in the autumn of 1956 for teaching Chinese as a second language. Currently, the MTC is the largest and the most renowned Chinese language center, with around 1,700 students from more than 70 countries enrolled each academic quarter (three months.) 
MTC students come from different cultures and language backgrounds. They share the common goal of learning to communicate in Chinese effectively--some for employment; some for interests in Chinese culture and history. Many students have never learned Chinese before they enroll at the MTC, whereas some are good enough to start at intermediate and advanced levels. No matter what your motivation for learning Chinese is or the level of your Chinese, the MTC will do all it can to help you make rapid progress.

NATIVE PRONUNCIATION : 
-- each phrase with speech of native speaker help you speak chinese correctly.

ALWAYS LEARN PHRASES, NOT INDIVIDUAL WORDS: 
▶ Meaning: Phrases are easier to remember, because they have meaning, they paint a picture, they tell a story. 
▶ Speed: When you learn phrases instead of a word, you're learning how to use that word correctly, and it’s much faster. When we're children, we learn with phrases, groups of words, not just one word by one word by one word. Word by word is slow. 
▶ Pronunciation: In real life some groups of words are said as though it were a single word, in one breath-group, without pausing. If you stop to take a breath in the middle of the phrase, you are not saying it correctly, and you risk being misunderstood.

Teuida: Learn Languages,"<p><strong>Learn Spanish, Korean and Japanese</strong> language by speaking from the start!


Practice speaking essential expressions in first-person POV scenarios.



<strong>👀 ""But I can just learn it by watching Netflix!?”</strong>


Just like if you were learning how to swim, you’d go into a pool instead of watching videos of Michael Phelps swimming. You can't learn Korean by listening to BTS, Japanese by watching anime or Spanish by eating tacos! Don't get us wrong, we too love listening to Kpop, watching anime and eating tacos. But if your goal is to ACTUALLY SPEAK, you have to, well – SPEAK! TEUIDA's first-person POV conversations will get you speaking everyday expressions in real-life scenarios.



<strong>⏳ 3 min > 30 min</strong>


We believe that 3 minutes of actual speaking will help you more than 30 minutes watching someone else speaks.


Why waste your precious time learning about languages when you can learn by speaking it yourself? Our interactive lessons not only get you to speak with the tutors but gives instant feedback on your pronunciation.



<strong>😏 Overcome fear of speaking</strong>

Research shows that one of the greatest barriers to speaking a language is confidence. After all, what's the point of knowing all the grammar rules and verb conjugations if you can't speak when the moment comes? TEUIDA helps you overcome fear of speaking by simulating real-life scenarios but without all the social anxiety. (i.e. Our characters won't throw shade at you for mispronouncing!)



Here’s a list of things that make TEUIDA different:


<strong>🎯 Essential expressions</strong>

No more weird, awkward phrases (translated by bots) that no one actually use in real life. (Let's be honest, when was the last time you had to say ""I am a boy, you are a woman"" in real-life?)



<strong>🎯 Effective curriculum</strong>


Once you master our curriculum, you will be able to know the basic vocabularies, grammars and of course, speak to your friends in Korean and Japanese. 



<strong>🎯 Taught by Bilingual Tutors</strong>


Our crazy selection of fully bilingual tutors not only speak your target language but understand where you’re coming from. They know exactly what to teach you because they've been in your shoes!



<strong>🎯 AI Pronunciation Analysis</strong>


What's the point of repeating sentences aloud if you can't tell whether you're pronouncing it right? TEUIDA has a convenient voice recognition system that will give instant feedback on your pronunciation.



<strong>🎯 Fun, Interactive Stories</strong>


We believe that learning and fun are not mutually exclusive. In fact, learning is most effective when it's fun! You'll find yourself laughing, screaming and at times even cringing with the characters.



<strong>🎯 Real-life Scenarios</strong>


Real-life everyday situations! Everything from ordering a drink at the cafe to asking for directions! 



<strong>🎯 Culture-specific tips</strong>


A wise man once said that ""the person who learns language without learning culture risks becoming a fluent fool"". We believe understanding culture is the key to learning language. So we hand-selected each scenario to reflect the culture-specific elements of each country.





So... what are you waiting for? <strong>Stop reading and start speaking with TEUIDA!</strong>



===========


Please note you will need a TEUIDA Premium plan in order to access all content and exclusive features.
We only use the microphone's voice recognition in to evaluate your pronunciation.

Mirinae - Learn Korean with AI,"<b>Are you learning Korean? Mirinae helps you understand all the parts-of-speech and grammar patterns in any Korean text that you give it.</b>

<b>◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher! </b>
You enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify & explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases & clauses in the sentence.

Click on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..

All this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.

<b>◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web</b>
There is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.

When enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.

<b>◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar & Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary</b>
Mirinae has a built-in dictionary & searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.

<b>◉ High tech!!</b>
Mirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.

It also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.

<b>◉ FAQ</b>
•How to use Mirinae?
Visit https://mirinae.io/#/support 
 
• What is Android version compatibility?
Mirinae works with Android version 5.1 or greater and may be affected by other settings on your device. If you experience issues with the App, please ensure that you are running Android version 5.1 or higher.  If you are unable to update your Android version, installing the update to the Android System WebView available on Play Store may allow Mirinae to function correctly.

Mirinae helps you understand all the parts-of-speech and grammar patterns in any Korean text that you give it.</b><br><br><b>◉ Let Mirinae be your AI Korean Teacher! </b><br>You enter a Korean sentence and Mirinae will translate the sentence, show you all the individual parts of speech, find and explain any grammar patterns present, explain the particles and honorifics and verb conjugations, identify &amp; explain any idioms or neologisms used, and draw out a parse-tree showing all the individual phrases &amp; clauses in the sentence.<br><br>Click on anything in the explanation for more details, alternate word definitions, example uses, related patterns, cross-references to learning sites and major textbooks, and much more..<br><br>All this allows the learner to explore Korean wherever they encounter it, perhaps an example sentence in a dictionary, some song lyrics or drama dialog, etc., discover its meaning, syntax, grammar patterns and any idioms used, and then to explore and continue learning, finding other examples of the patterns and words used.<br><br><b>◉ Learn while watching Kdrama or browsing the web</b><br>There is also a Chrome Extension version that lets you explore and learn from Korean text you encounter on any website, including Kdrama subtitles on streaming sites like Viki.com, Netflix and Youtube.<br><br>When enabled, the Mirinae extension will detect Korean on any web-page, so you can explore and get a deep understanding of any Korean directly within the page so that it can be very easily used to augment existing Korean teaching, reference and translation sites and video streaming sites. Visit the Chrome Store and search for “Mirinae”.<br><br><b>◉ Built-in Dictionary, Searchable Grammar &amp; Idiom Reference and Grammar-term Glossary</b><br>Mirinae has a built-in dictionary &amp; searchable grammar reference and can also be used as a deep, interactive Korean reference that is driven by examples of the things you want to search for.    The library has a large and growing number of idiom patterns and neologisms (newly-coined words), essential for understanding modern spoken Korean, Kpop lyrics and Kdrama dialog.<br><br><b>◉ High tech!!</b><br>Mirinae uses advanced machine learning, natural language processing and a non-deterministic phrase-structure parser, coupled with a proprietary regular-expression grammar-pattern, idiom and neologism library to build a lexical and grammatical analysis of the text, showing a breakdown of the text into its component words and particles and suffixes and other parts-of-speech along with a display of its structure in terms of phrases and predicates and clauses.<br><br>It also uses an advanced, bi-language embedding-vector meaning disambiguator to provide likely meanings for individual words in the sentence, which is not easily determined from a full sentence-translation, as you might get from a standard translation site.<br><br><b>◉ FAQ</b><br>•How to use Mirinae?<br>Visit https://mirinae.io/#/support <br> <br>• What is Android version compatibility?<br>Mirinae works with Android version 5.1 or greater and may be affected by other settings on your device. If you experience issues with the App, please ensure that you are running Android version 5.1 or higher.  If you are unable to update your Android version, installing the update to the Android System WebView available on Play Store may allow Mirinae to function correctly.<br><br><b>◉ NOTE</b><br>• If you have any questions or suggestions please contact us:<br>  - helpdesk: team@mirinae.io<br>  - website: https://mirinae.io<br>  - instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mirinae.io/<br>  - twitter: https://twitter.com/mirinae_io<br>  - youtube: https://www.youtube.com/c/mirinae_io",Learn Korean daily sentences using Kpop lyrics Kdrama subtitles with fun lessons,"100,000+",100000,327514,3.6296296,1061.0,32.0,"[196, 117, 39, 235, 471]",0.0,True,USD,False,,,,True,$6.99 - $69.99 per item,"Mirinae Technologies, Inc.",9161379624140783911,support@mirinae.io,https://mirinae.io,,https://company.mirinae.io/privacy-policy/,Education,EDUCATION,"[{'name': 'Education', 'id': 'EDUCATION'}]",https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/k9sMGwUE9vR9-bfBxLntv0MeHW2KQA1SNtuHKKfy7fqbijNeJ9iprpnJh6GqqykGy64,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ayUmnp9cfcrLcKFJS_1WKiouM7w295Gtvo_ETk88FWnAnLJIVQQ13xKHbho4230sm2sE,"['https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0mjeVIquvCPGrGQk1PpJdTxWgYE9sACKHFxWLPRgWmTRgb--ehWLQHsrRwmFmt9SpA', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/kB6QEJ_x6B2oPX1WzxR9v7mHxGEMwsxO7iG4XL3Cf41ap1LvY54OSVb3U0PwwOuqzg', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5fQVQwVj2trOXdbhi2r6ppuIKJpTKnYTEO8wKjAd-E5aCzzE8dEmGfCeJuTzIuV6nwA', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WiZ-nUgARKCgTOxPL3lhBTQkmeO22c8ljp6_8SjvNsMzcbn_OEIhUCS2pbMMDWqDwMI', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/D8ht3yA3wDasN1LKfp6PvpikHJl3tNpY7w_WFvR5gFShrih5-rMP-2MNB0kJMXp5DB8', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/1PIs959kYcMo2xJ8HxGOhIl3ZHnhSl8TSyQhtyVsj71R8fizUAErPlsmUNlPECf46M6T', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rgv-XKUuJe05YiIWK8mgekfEEq7XtWfDOSAYnF_6DvXDh8CSZa_irtkh4Yy2OULBGo3J', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/rvnm25P5_nGowLuiB8WyAhYlwQ1mcuC7qMbFlRAM6IV100iP3Uqd8kMerrOksrypRXS-', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/dBKqk5SlSRTmlOleEpxgQwwELzwx27QbG7CE_PAdHXMMxZJdfuTwFYVqvd79GSY2jkfX', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/zyrmHTFcDuNVDDDehI9BQIQQvbilEDvAjo6-OH7K4wIAJChm-5I7YrH4HOrTkb_BXYI', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/IUABqfxDdNbRGa9JdKWUE3dA6X8QKIRoA7mWCuP-zLxqN411MhYm9I5otZfku-79pQ', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/RM6lnX9N3cV0biNchRNaktA5dkWt82-xtkwB7dGugrdftavJuG9mk3ST8oLGFIpjhQ', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/L1Fdg2cYuxqEU8BrUXBFMKCo41yW2nwEy73FZoH2HGvJ7Vw5MukNV-zSP73mra4d3A', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/pEMzV8dUzJ-HpFfXDg6Vsb2i8tuzuGO_h-hDP3viH6fFTxpREttt0NP4XnWfXaHy5x5W', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/84SfNIXFC3M_1Bp95FmCXaNdWkmZD8_jZ6PYW1hpyDg6-vE771kEZSGg9WdXzEbFf6M', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/l3V1fS5zBrms9s4PJiFhEaZIiGeds_kjLAPpdI2SrMXTwwY0FLk_WYuNLgHQ5uGMsQ0E', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/To53bYvRgZtk91rJPRATrYDSjmXhHObbwG7d3xdOGjCg0UHG9INGKnSo-BQJnkbMvW4', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/u070E58fgz42AEYYPkEio7TxfDujmJG2MwRu0igMysbM0GPWOXhDk4A6Qmex1oWC_pmm', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9pFfgvi33fJzZat0fXxZpOR9_0vw-7ZCh_xXU1cqvSmK837uFk7yw3KOkNitosqp4kE', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/9qEBL09-arxz-8bFHE-Rn5XhehyyImljtWyHsVLjBWQICDJQrJfG-1Ak1oVLxhSobcY', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/0YeDRKt1xY9Df-AH3vYATkm1V4ZRL0bECYhRMMBEXS2HzAmiAcpBIfPbEzlcfG9ft-w', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/quN0LTcJJGkpu9GewoFVo4flEQN2x-mizgbbF4zEjb9TgghvnK3_s6juOOgeOZhGJUw', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/-sxkZsuOIbme9JHEQZLl63vDzAtfsCds1hfJAw8XEE9y0l_w4HzC_jqQPpslBkbQRw', 'https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/TsT1NonzuI7EsynkGzakDEaeuX_l-t67v9nLcqXqBUm_Ia2xZdtO-MbV1ej9s-PV8_s']",https://www.youtube.com/embed/8TpUTXL60R0?ps=play&vq=large&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0,https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/ayUmnp9cfcrLcKFJS_1WKiouM7w295Gtvo_ETk88FWnAnLJIVQQ13xKHbho4230sm2sE,Everyone,,False,False,"May 30, 2021","Dec 13, 2024",1734094586.0,2.2.2,[],com.mirinae.mirinae,https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mirinae.mirinae&hl=en&gl=us,LANGUAGE_LEARNING

Podo Korean – Learn Korean,"Hello! I'm Jeongwoo Park (Danny), a professional Korean teacher. 
Let me introduce you to ""Podo Korean,"" an app designed for serious Korean learners.

■ Top-quality lessons 
Since 2017, I’ve taught Korean to hundreds of students worldwide. 
I’ve poured all that experience into this app, allowing you to learn Korean just like you’re receiving private lessons. 
All audio and video content is recorded by a professional Korean teacher, so you can learn authentic pronunciation from native speakers, avoiding any robotic or unnatural sounds.

■ Reading practice 
Do you want to practice reading but find Korean books or texts too hard? 
To help you, I've written reading materials using simple words and expressions. 
Each sentence is short and easy to understand, with translations and native speaker audio provided. 
""Podo Korean"" makes reading practice accessible for everyone.

■ Writing practice with corrections 
Write sentences using the expressions you’ve learned! 
A Korean teacher will review your writing and correct it to make your sentences sound more natural. 
You can even save the corrected sentences as flashcards.

■ Flashcards 
Repetitive practice is key to language learning. 
With just a tap on the star icon, you can turn lessons, reading content, and corrected sentences into flashcards. 
Practice anytime using the Flashcards menu.

■ Multi-language support
Our app supports 7 languages to make learning Korean easier: English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Indonesian, and Russian. 
Choose your preferred language and start learning Korean today!

■ Premium membership 
You can learn Hangul and basic expressions for free (ads are required). 
But for more detailed and effective learning, we recommend the premium version.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Italian language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Italian grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Italian phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Italian pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Italian words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Italian clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Italian. Mondly teaches you Italian vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational Italian.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Italian vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Italian clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Italian verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning Italian is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Italian lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","Learn Italian with free lessons daily.

Bootstrap Russian Grammar,"Packed with 200 grammar topics and over 3000 annotated examples, *Bootstrap Russian Grammar* is a proven grammar based approach that gets you communicating in Russian precisely and with confidence.

""⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ At the time of writing I have 2060 consecutive days on Duolingo. During that time I’ve appreciated Duo for the vocabulary but found it very difficult to learn grammar. I’ve got a couple of grammar books (that I don’t have the time to properly study) and I’ve tried several grammar apps (that are characteristically poorly written, poorly explained and generally very unhelpful). I’ve learned more Russian grammar from this app in three days than I have in the past five years. If you’re serious about understanding Russian, this is the best £25 you’ll spend.""

'Bootstrap Russian Grammar' provides the solid grounding in grammar basics that is the key to mastering Russian as a second language. Grammatical rules and concepts are clearly explained in order of importance. Each topic builds on the last - step-by-step. 

Hundreds of new words are introduced alongside the grammar to help learners quickly build their Russian speaking and comprehension prowess.

Starting from the beginning, the idea is progress in small self-contained steps (called 'topics'). Each topic builds on the last, by incrementally adding new grammatical patterns, new vocabulary and lots and lots of useful examples. 

Each topic includes a thorough explanation of the grammar and then lots of examples that illustrate the grammar. Each example includes an English translation, as well as notes highlighting how each example illustrates that topic's grammar, as well as the meanings of new Russian words.

A companion BOOK is now available called ""BootStrap Russian Grammar"". The book contains all the content contained in this book - including 200 grammar topics and over 3000 example phrases. 

Just search for ""BootStrap Russian Grammar"" on Amazon.

The book and mobile app are easy to coordinate using QR codes. Just scan the QR code at the beginning of any chapter in the book with the app and it will take you straight to the topic where you will find all the examples with the high-quality audio matching the chapter in the book.

So if you prefer to have the grammar set out in book form but would also like to be able to listen to the example sentences, then the book/app combination is perfect for you.","Packed with 200 grammar topics and over 3000 annotated examples, *Bootstrap Russian Grammar* is a proven grammar based approach that gets you communicating in Russian precisely and with confidence.<br><br>&quot;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ At the time of writing I have 2060 consecutive days on Duolingo.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Brazilian Portuguese language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Brazilian Portuguese grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Brazilian Portuguese phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Brazilian Portuguese pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Brazilian Portuguese words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Brazilian Portuguese clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Portuguese. Mondly teaches you Portuguese vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational Portuguese.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Portuguese vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Brazilian Portuguese clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Portuguese verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning Portuguese is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Portuguese lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","Learn Brazilian Portuguese with free lessons daily.

<b>Only 10-15 minutes per day</b> Spending just 10-15 minutes every day, will easily allow you to remember all useful Portuguese words. While memorizing words, the frequency of lesson is more important than duration of each lesson. 10 minutes on each day of the week will be more productive than one hour of tuition a week.

<b>One minute lessons</b> Taking into account busyness of modern life, we designed each lesson in the way so it would never take more than one minute to complete it! So you no longer need to search for free time to practice Portuguese! Simply, once you get a chance, launch the app and do one lesson at a time =) Short sessions will not affect efficiency of word memorization.

<b>Only useful Portuguese words</b> Portuguese for Beginners: LinDuo HD is a free and quick start to learn Portuguese language! Unlike others, we have only the most useful words, which are divided into 180 topic based lessons. Quality is here!

Teach-yourself Portuguese is designed, that it will use your visual and echoic memory to help you memorize Portuguese words fast and easy!

<b>Special illustrations</b> We use only specially developed infographics (developed by psychologists), so your eyes can quickly identify meaning of word or action without stressing them with small unnecessary details.

<b>Word pronunciation by native speakers</b> Our app will help you master pronunciation of Portuguese words! Each word is recording by professional native speaker! Additionally, in the settings you can choose between male or female voice.

<b>Dynamic lesson difficulty</b> The app changes lesson difficulty gradually as you progress. To achieve this, it keeps stats for EVERY word! Example: in the spelling mode, initially you need to insert several missing letters in a word, then create a word having extra letters and finally, when you are ready, you will need to type the entire word on the keyboard.

<b>Modes for quick learning</b> The App includes four additional lesson types which are made of Favorites, Difficult, Old, Random words. You can add any word to your favorites and later create custom lesson from your Favorite words. Words are automatically added to ""Difficult"" (the ones you struggle to memorize) and ""Old"" (which you have not reviewed for a long time) sections. A ""Random"" mode will create a unique lesson.

<b>Do not need to know how to read</b> If you cannot read yet, no problem! Each word has a transcription in your language! And for more experienced ones, in the settings, you can choose a phonetic (like in a dictionary) transcription.

<b>Additional features</b> Thanks to your reviews, we are constantly updating the app to make it better! To help you take care of your eyesight, with just one tap, you can activate dark theme. If you temporarily do not have internet access, no problem! The App can work offline as well!

<b>Review Past Material</b> Many good apps do not pay enough attention to review past material! For this purpose we created the word game ""True or False"". It is very simple, but it's addictive and the most importantly, it helps to repeat past material and never to forget it!

Practice Portuguese,"Master European Portuguese from Portugal with interactive, step-by-step lessons and a massive library of dialogues (with translated subtitles).

Since 2012, we've helped thousands of expats, travellers, and students worldwide learn Portuguese. Our small-but-mighty team focuses on only 1 language, so we can take a more practical, human approach to the unique challenges of learning European Portuguese: closed vowel pronunciation, the subtleties of formal vs. informal language, and much more.

Practice Portuguese was founded when Joel (from Canada) struggled to find non-Brazilian learning resources, so he teamed up with Rui (from Portugal) to solve this once and for all!

** TRUSTPILOT SCORE: Excellent 4.9 / 238 Ratings **

Nemo Portuguese,"Nemo is designed to start you speaking the most useful words in Portuguese immediately and confidently. With millions of downloads from around the world, Nemo is now available for Android phones and tablets.

✓ Every Portuguese word is pronounced clearly in high quality audio from a native speaker.
✓ All audio is downloaded to your device, and is available offline or in airplane mode.
✓ Master your accent with the Speech Studio. Simply record yourself saying a phrase and then hear your voice next to the teacher’s. Then try again. You’ll be AMAZED how quickly your foreign accent melts away.
✓ Nemo is not built around lessons at all. It is meant to be picked up throughout the day, whenever you have a few minutes to spare.
✓ NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE of Portuguese is required.

Nemo targets the words and phrases most often used in conversation. For beginners, we’ve prepared “If You Only Learn 10 Things”, “If You Only Learn 50 Things”, and “If You Only Learn 100 Things” lists for a fast introduction to the essentials. Intermediate learners can progress to a course of the highest frequency words needed for travel and business and begin to have conversations in Portuguese in a month. Advanced students will benefit most from the Speech Studio technology to correct their foreign accent.

With Nemo, you can customize flashcards to exercise the language skill you want to improve. When beginning a new topic, setup flashcards to practice translation of Portuguese to English so you can build familiarity with new words. Next, switch to translate English to Portuguese to train your recall and ability to speak. To complete mastery, switch to cards that specialize in fine-tuning your listening and perfecting your pronunciation.

Any card can be marked as a favorite, allowing you to make your own custom deck of cards to focus on the words of the day. Turn on Review Mode to recap what you practiced earlier in the day to boost your memory retention.

Dive into what you want to learn at any time. The phrasebook offers quick access to the vocabulary in the app through a Portuguese-English dictionary interface. Nemo also functions as a translator. Simply find the words you need in the search interface and play its audio through the device speaker.

◆ Get off the beaten path or find comfort with traveler phrases.
◆ Build your proficiency with numbers and the most important verbs and sentence building blocks.
◆ Supports a “Word Gender” mode to display extra information about the gender of words.

Portuguese is one of the most widely used languages in the world. Born in Portugal, it is now the primary language in Brazil and used in several African countries. The audio in this app is recorded by a native speaker of Brazilian Portuguese. This app will help you speak in Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon or São Paulo.

Use your new skills to make friends, impress old friends, bring smiles to children, get out of jams, experience new things, talk confidently, and make your travel and cultural experience more rich and fulfilling.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Arabic language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Arabic grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a foreigner. That’s the traditional way to learn a language.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Arabic phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Arabic pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Arabic words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Arabic clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of isolated words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Arabic. Mondly teaches you Arabic vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into short lessons and puts them into themed packs.

<b>Learn conversational Arabic.</b> Conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Arabic vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs, and speak Arabic clearly.

<b>Verb conjugations.</b> If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Arabic verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>Advanced Statistics.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>The Leaderboard.</b> See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly community family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>Adaptive Learning.</b> Learning Arabic is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Arabic lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language.","Learn Arabic with free lessons daily.

Arabius: Learn Saudi Arabic,"Learn Saudi Arabic in a natural way, without having to memorize or study!  Our unique ICE Methodology (Immersive, Customized, Experiential) gets you understanding and interacting with new words faster than any other methodology.

WHAT IS ARABIUS?
A revolutionary language learning methodology developed for our clients at our center in Riyadh. Rather than focusing on memorization and speaking, we focus first on simply understanding and interacting with words through fun and exciting games. Languages are not memorized, they are acquired naturally. No studying or memorizing required. Just play the games and you will start to understand basic words and sentences quicker than you ever thought possible.

WHY DO YOU FOCUS ON SAUDI ARABIC?
First of all, because we love Saudi! But also because Saudi Arabic is what people actually speak in daily life in KSA. Modern Standard Arabic is a beautiful and important language, but our focus is on helping you in real communication in daily life.Within a few sessions in our app, you will know common greetings and responses. And with a few more, you will be hearing and arranging complete sentences in Saudi Arabic
 
HOW IS ARABIUS BETTER?
Other language-learning apps are focused on either getting you hooked rather than actual learning OR rote memorization. Instead we focus on teaching you new words in an intuitive way.  Rather than focusing on speaking, we focus on teaching you to understand many words at once. We use recordings of native speakers rather than computer generated sounds so you can hear all the nuances of the language. We NEVER use English to teach Arabic! Translation methodologies do not work. Rather we use pictures to encourage your brain to associate the object with the sound of the new word.


KEY APP FEATURES:
MINI SESSIONS
After completing specified milestones, you will be able to pay (or use a coupon code) to attend a mini session! These are live video sessions with a native speaker for 30 minutes to practice your language skills. Sometimes, these mini sessions will be content reviews. Other times, there will be new content, specific to the mini sessions, that you will learn in your live session. This feature makes the Arabius App extremely unique from other language-learning apps. The ability to connect with a live, native speaker is a guarantee that your language is progressing, and is a goal to strive towards! 

CULTURE CARDS
As you venture through the sessions, you will earn golden dates as a reward for your efforts! These can be cashed in at our store for unique culture cards on interesting cultural topics (such as Arabic coffee!)

TOUR SAUDI
Since the Arabius App is entirely focused on Saudi Language and Culture, you will be traveling virtually through various regions of the country! Enjoy all the distinct aspects of Saudi Arabic learning language and culture as you visit the country virtually!

LEARNING STYLE
While the instructional language of the app is English, when it comes to teaching Arabic, you will find that no English is used! Everything is following our immersive methodology. Users will match sounds they hear to images they see, focusing on hearing and speaking first, and reading later. This allows for faster learning as it follows a more natural immersion style. It also allows for you to learn and understand unique words for foods, drinks, phrases, and items that are common in Saudi, but don’t always have a clear translation. 

SPACED REPETITION WORD STRENGTHENING
By strategically selecting when and how words are reviewed, repetition is minimized and language-learning speed remains efficient and effective.

Arabic alphabet for beginners,"Do you think learning to read Arabic by yourself is hard? Well not anymore!
Download our app today and start learning how to read and write Arabic. Begin with learning the alphabet through our interactive course which is divided into 27 lessons.  Each lesson focuses on just one letter (except for the first lesson). Each letter is thoroughly studied with descriptions, examples, various forms of application in writing, and also pronunciation. Once you complete all the lessons, you should find yourself easily and effectively capable of reading the Arabic language. 
The initial page of the application contains a list of lessons. On each line before the title of the lesson is a circle, showing the test results in percent. In each lesson, there is a test to check the passed material. The application is built on the well-known textbook «Muallim sani"" and preserves the order of the letters studied in that textbook (not in alphabetical order-- the alphabet can be viewed only by selecting the menu item ""Alphabet"").

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WORKING WITH THE PROGRAM:
To facilitate learning and understanding, the lessons are arranged in increasing complexity, from easy to difficult, so you need to start learning from the first lesson, and as you master the material, move on to the next lesson. First, go through the whole lesson by flipping the buttons below, back and forth, listening to the pronunciation of all the words and, if necessary, looking at the transliteration. Then, turn off the pronunciation and transliteration and read the whole lesson. After reading each word individually, check yourself by clicking on the scoring button (located at the bottom of the screen). After that, pass the test (the button is located on the top right) and, in case of successful passage, go to the next lesson. If difficulties arise, you can go through the lesson, again. Doing this program, you will easily master the Arabic letters and learn to read in Arabic.","Do you think learning to read Arabic by yourself is hard?

The entire TOEFL wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert TOEFL tutors, led by Chris Lele and Lucas Fink.

Review that really sticks

The TOEFL word list is also culled to only 600 so that you don't waste time learning unimportant words.

GRE Vocabulary Flashcards,"Magoosh has helped MILLIONS of students pass their GRE!

Master the 1500 most important GRE words with free flashcards! Practice every day to improve your vocab knowledge. Study to rectify your benightedness and prepare to trounce the GRE verbal section!


• 1500 vocab words picked by an expert GRE tutor

• Definitions and example sentences for every word

• Decks for every difficulty level

• Track your progress as you study

• Smart algorithm focuses your practice for efficient learning


This app gives you access to all of Magoosh’s GRE vocab flash cards.


Who makes the flashcards?

===

The entire GRE wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert GRE tutor, Chris Lele. He has been teaching the GRE for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is nigh unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter.


How well will I learn the words?

===

Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. The GRE word list is culled so that you focus on only the most important words.


Your practice will focus on the words that you need to review the most to make sure the words you learn will really stick.


What is Magoosh?

===

About the developer

My name is Sam and I am an Academic English teacher. I have found that my students often are able to understand new words, but find it difficult to use them in the correct situations. I decided to write this app to not only teach students the most important academic words, but also help them know how and when to use them. Consequently, the dictionary entries contain definitions AND example sentences written at a level of English that learners can understand.

Spelling, synonyms and grammar is all covered for each word to help students remember what they learn. 

If you are unable to pay the small fee for the full app, send me an email (see additional information) and I’ll send you a code to unlock the full app for free!

SAT Flashcards: Prep & Vocab,"Master important SAT concepts with Magoosh's SAT flashcards! It's easy to use and will help you memorize key concepts quickly!

• English and Math SAT concepts 
• 350 vocab words picked by an expert SAT tutor
• Definitions and example sentences for every concept and word
• Decks for every difficulty level
• Track your progress as you study
• Smart algorithm focuses your practice for efficient learning

This app gives you access to all of Magoosh’s SAT flashcards. Sign in with a Magoosh account (or create a new free one) to save your progress to the web so that you can continue your practice online at https://sat.magoosh.com/flashcards

Written by SAT experts
=====
The entire SAT wordlist is selected and defined with usage examples by Magoosh’s expert SAT tutors, headed by Chris Lele. He has been teaching the SAT for more than 10 years, runs a popular vocabulary series on YouTube and he’s also written an eBook on vocabulary. He is unbeatable in Scrabble, or any other word game for that matter.

Review that really sticks
=====
Academic research has found that memories are formed by repeated exposure to new information, so Magoosh’s flashcard app uses a spaced repetition system. Concepts and words you are learning will reappear frequently (occurring less frequently the better you know them) and words you already know won’t be repeated. 

“I really like the way the words appear and the simple interface to show progress of the user. You guys have put good use of algorithms so one comes out learning the words well. The best flashcard app to date.” - Arif

“Absolutely awesome. This is an excellent way to significantly improve vocabulary in a short amount of time. I learned 100 new words while waiting for my flight at the airport. Good job Magoosh!” - Tameka

uTalk - Learn 150+ Languages,"<b>Learn languages fast</b>: uTalk gets results because every word you hear is in your new language and you <b>speak, listen and understand from Day One.</b>

The app has a huge range of 150+ languages and with free starter words in each, you can try it risk-free. Score full marks in the games and you can also unlock an <b>extra topic in your language for free.


uTalk helps you speak a new language for these 3 reasons:</b>

1. <b>Learn from the locals: We record native speakers</b> so you can hear every word pronounced clearly.  We then get you to <b>mimic their pronunciation and compare your intonation with theirs.</b> Practise until you get it right – you can even slow the audio down if it’s too fast.

2. <b>Crammed full of words:</b> Useful everyday words and phrases. Topics, like Food and Drink, take around two to three hours to complete. But you can dip in for just five minutes at a time or longer. <b>With 60+ topics, that’s a total of 180 hours of learning.</b>  

3. <b>Keeps you motivated:</b> Check your scores on progress bars as you move through five progressively difficult games. To get full marks, you’ll have to know the words as well as your own language.

<b>Who’s it for?</b> uTalk’s tried and trusted way to learn a new language has been developed over 30 years and is <b>perfect for beginners.</b> But, because of its wide-ranging language, it’s also <b>invaluable for intermediates</b> looking to fill in gaps in their vocabulary and pronunciation.

<b>How it works:</b> Subscribe to everything on uTalk or buy individual languages or topics. Learn on any device, at home or on the move. The app automatically syncs between your devices. Work offline by downloading content.

Brainscape: Smarter Flashcards,"Delete your old flashcard apps! Brainscape has the <b>SMARTEST</b> AI-powered flashcard maker, the <b>BEST</b> marketplace of expert flashcards, and the <b>MOST EFFECTIVE</b> spaced repetition study algorithm on the planet.

<u>How does it work?</u> Brainscape’s intelligent study system has been designed in accordance with decades of proven cognitive science to help you learn faster and remember longer than with any other flashcard app. (And we don’t waste time on games. Our flashcards are for serious learners.)

Brainscape distills any subject down into bite-sized facts (neatly organized into decks and classes), which are posed as question-and-answer pairs, compelling you to actively recall information from scratch. You then rate how well you know each concept on a scale of 1 to 5, and Brainscape determines the perfect time interval at which to repeat that flashcard again.

AlgoApp Flashcards,"Ranked #1 Education app in multiple countries world-wide. Featured in the New York Times.

Learning Chinese characters? Kanji? Medicine? Another subject with lots to memorize? With that much to learn, you need the right flashcard app, to get the most from your study time.

That's why AlgoApp uses an improved form of Spaced Repetition (SRS), built with Artificial Intelligence (AI), to maximize the amount of learning you get done in each study session. When you go to study, the AI chooses which flashcards you need to work on, based on a detailed analysis of your progress. It's like a coach, for your brain.

Make your own flashcards, styled how you like. AlgoApp lets you use colors, bulleted lists, and more. Or search through millions of flashcards that are ready for you to download. Your choice.

You get all this power, wrapped in a simple, polished app.

  • Create decks on the go
  • Make cards using photos from your camera

POWERFUL

  • Detailed stats on each of your decks, and individual cards too
  • For advanced formatting, supports HTML and CSS
  • Text-to-speech (TTS) that reads parts of your cards in English or other languages
  • Automatic translation
  • Automatic furigana generation annotation for Japanese kanji
  • Study offline, and your new cards and progress sync when you're back online

USER-FRIENDLY
  • Dashboard that shows your overall progress
  • Study at any time; doesn't force you to study cards on a rigid schedule
  • Study your recent decks from the Dashboard in just 2 taps
  • ""Night Mode"" that's easy on your eyeballs when studying in the dark

Our digital bilingual picture books are fun, multicultural and something that parents and children will love reading together.

<2>Language display options

Our bilingual or dual language eBook app displays one language at the top of the screen and the other at the bottom. You can change languages at any time, or remove one language if you prefer to use the app as a normal single language book reader. You can even remove both languages and go wordless! Wordless picture books are a fun way to promote creativity and imagination. You can enjoy our illustrations, talk about what you see and even create your own story.

<h2>Benefits of bilingualism</h2>

At Unuhi we are passionate about language learning, cultural learning, and multilingualism. Educational studies show that reading stories for language learning provides great results and bilingual books build vocabulary and understanding in both languages. Learning two languages early on in life makes it easier to learn more languages later on.

<h2>We’d love your feedback!</h2>

Notepad - simple notes,"Notepad is a small and fast notetaking app for making notes, memos, or just any plain text content. Features:
* simple interface that most of the users find easy to use
* no limits on note's length or number of notes (of course there's a limit to phone's storage)
* creating and editing text notes
* importing notes from txt files, saving notes as txt files
* sharing notes with other apps (e.g. sending a note by email)
* notes widget allowing to quickly create or edit notes, working like post it notes (stick a memo to home screen)
* backup function for saving and loading notes from a backup file (zip file)
* app password lock
* color themes (including dark theme)
* note categories
* automatic note saving
* undo/redo changes in notes
* lines in background, numbered lines in a note
* technical support
* search function that can quickly find text in notes
* unlock app with biometrics (e.g. fingerprint or face recognition)

It may be obvious, but notes in the app can be used in many ways. For example as a to do list to increase productivity. A sort of digital planner to store shopping list or to organize the day. Notes can be put on the home screen as reminders. Each task could be stored in a seperate note or one big todo note could be used.

** Important **
Please remember to make a backup copy of notes before formatting a phone or buying a new phone. Since the 1.7.0 version the app will also use phone's device copy, if it's turned on in the device's and the app's settings.

* Why do I advise to not install the app on an SD card?
I follow the official advice to block installing on an SD card apps that use widgets. This app uses widgets, which are like icons for the notes, and can be placed on a phone's home screen (for example).

If you have any additional questions, just contact me by email: notepad.free@outlook.com .

Thank you.

Oxford Advanced Learner's Dict,"A one-stop dictionary reference app for learners of English! The following products are available: 

- Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary 
- Oxford Collocations Dictionary 
- Oxford Learner’s Thesaurus 

The <b>Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary</b> is the world’s bestselling advanced-level dictionary for learners of English. It has helped millions of learners to develop their English skills for work and study, and leads the way to more confident, successful communication in English. It contains over 86,000 words, 95,000 phrases, 112,000 meanings and 237,000 examples, all using clear and simple language to help non-native speakers learn more easily. 

The <b>Oxford Collocations Dictionary</b> shows you which words work together and helps you express your ideas naturally and convincingly. It is especially useful for writing essays or preparing for exams in English. For example, which adjectives can you use to describe ‘scenery’? Which verbs can you use with ‘challenge’?

The Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD, https://lod.lu, www.lod.lu) is an official tool destined at documenting the Luxembourgish language. Its origins go back to 29 July 1999 and the Règlement grand-ducal portant création du Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise.
 
The LOD is considered an orthographic reference conveying the meaning of common Luxembourgish expressions by means of translation elements in four different languages: German, French, English and Portuguese. The LOD can also be used as a writing assistance or translation tool.

Alongside translations, the following information can be found in the LOD: example sentences, proverbs and figures of speech with an explanation, synonyms, information regarding pronunciation (audio file and IPA-transcription), sign language videos.

So-called info boxes include orthographic, grammatical or historical information that would be out of place in the more rigid frame of the dictionary entries.

An error-tolerant search enables the user to look up content in the five LOD languages in an easy and intuitive manner. An advanced search also makes it possible to call up lists of Luxembourgish expressions by respecting certain criteria (wild card character, part of speech, phonetics, language register, ...)

Additionally, the expressions are subdivided into categories: job descriptions, animals, insults, vehicles, fruit and vegetables, ...

The Zenter fir d’Lëtzebuerger Sprooch – Centre for the Luxembourgish language (http://zls.lu) was created with the law of 20 July 2018 on the promotion of the Luxembourgish language and is in charge of the maintenance and development of the LOD.

Den LOD fir ënnerwee – déi offiziell App vum Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire
 
D’Originne vum Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD, https://lod.lu, www.lod.lu), engem offiziellen Tool fir d'Dokumentatioun vun der Lëtzebuerger Sprooch, ginn zeréck op de Règlement grand-ducal vum 29. Juli 1999 portant création du Conseil permanent de la langue luxembourgeoise.
 
Den LOD gëllt als orthografesch Referenz a vermëttelt de Sënn vun de gängege lëtzebuergesche Wierder unhand vun eendeitegen Iwwersetzungselementer a véier Sproochen: Däitsch, Franséisch, Englesch a Portugisesch.
Den Dictionnaire kann awer och als Schreif- an/oder als Iwwersetzungshëllef gebraucht ginn.
 
Niewent den Iwwersetzunge stinn ënner anerem och nach dës Informatiounen am LOD: Beispillssätz, Spréchwierder a Riedewendunge mat enger Erklärung, Synonymmen, Informatiounen iwwer d’Aussprooch (Audio-Datei an IPA-Transkriptioun), Gebäerdevideoen.
 
A sougenannten Infoboxe sti wichteg orthografesch, grammatesch oder historesch Informatiounen, déi net an de rigide Kader vun den Dictionnaires-Artikele passen.
 
Iwwer eng feelertolerant Sich ka ganz einfach an intuitiv an de fënnef LOD-Sproochen no Inhalter gesicht ginn. Eng erweidert Sich erlaabt et awer och, fir sech Lëschte mat lëtzebuergesche Wierder uweisen ze loossen, déi verschiddene Krittären (Jokerzeechen, Wuertaart, Phoneetik, Sproochregëster, ...) entspriechen.
 
Ausserdeem sinn d’Wierder a Kategorien ënnerdeelt: Beruffsbezeechnungen, Déieren, Frechheeten, Gefierer, Uebst & Geméis, ...

Reverso Translate and Learn,"Reverso is the all-in-one tool that provides you high-quality translations and helps you improve your language skills seamlessly. It's magic, and it's free.

Teachers or translators, students or business professionals, beginners or advanced learners use Reverso to enrich their vocabulary and read, write, and speak with more accuracy and confidence.

Reverso Context relies on data collected from millions of real-life multilingual texts computed with powerful ""big data"" algorithms and machine learning techniques. This way, we make sure you enjoy the most accurate and relevant results as well as a learning experience customized to your needs. 

Download the Reverso app, and you'll have millions of words and expressions at your fingertips, with their translations in multiple languages. Just type or speak a word or an expression and find accurate translations, illustrated by examples of real usage. Then, you can easily memorize the ones that are relevant to you with our learning activities. 

How context helps you better translate? 

The search results (translations) for a specific word or expression are weaved within real-life sentences extracted from official documents, movie subtitles, product descriptions. The examples help you understand how translations can vary upon context and select the most suitable one to avoid embarrassing mistakes. 

Learn from your translations with fun activities 

Reverso goes far beyond a simple translation app, breaking new ground also in the language learning field. 

Our app includes flashcards, quizzes, and games generated based on your searches to help you focus on the words and expressions that matter to you. They use SRS (Spaced Repetition System) learning, enabling you to memorize new terms smoothly, without the constraints of the old-school learning methods. Forget about the tedious task of studying a standard selection of words to reach language proficiency. With the Reverso app, language learning becomes fun: you play with flashcards to regularly practice the words and expressions you've recently discovered, and memorize them along the way. At your own learning pace, in the limit of your available time. 

Although language learning is fun and flexible, the whole process gains structures through learning strategy and statistics. You can fine-tune the category of new terms you want to include in your learning activities, according to your linguistic interests and needs. In the learning statistics, you will be able to follow-up on your progress. 

The bits and bytes: 

* Translation in 14 languages: Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, Polish, Dutch, Arabic, Russian, Romanian, Japanese, Turkish, Hebrew,  Chinese and we are working on more.
* Search by speaking and hear back the pronunciation of the translations

Our story:
◆ Why create a product like Transgull?

From horse-drawn carriages to airplanes, from letters to the internet, technology has taken us across every ocean on Earth. Yet, language barriers still impede our communication.

Existing translation software often falls short, producing incomprehensible content or inappropriate jokes, making it difficult for us to trust them fully.

In the era of AI, we may finally overcome these challenges.

Transgull aims to be your most reliable translation companion, helping you communicate with the world without fearing language barriers. Together, let's spread our wings and soar.

◆ Why is it called TransGull?

A seagull is a bird that can freely fly over the ocean.

TransGull aims to be a tool that allows you to freely cross oceans and language barriers for communication.

We also included a pun: 'TransGull' sounds like 'TransGold', symbolizing that our translation service is of the highest quality, like gold!

◆ What problems can TransGull help you solve?

In the current version of TransGull, we've implemented conversational translation, real-time interpretation, and video translation. This allows you to effortlessly communicate with others anytime through the TransGull app. Additionally, you can upload photos during conversations for context-based translations, making interactions even smoother.

You can use the TransGull app in various scenarios:

- Asking for directions when you're out exploring.
- Taking photos of restaurant menus to quickly translate them and smoothly communicate your order with the server.
- Translating descriptions at attractions to enhance your travel experience.
- Watching and understanding interesting foreign-language videos online.

Perhaps you're traveling abroad;
Perhaps you're using a foreign service and need to talk with their customer support;
Perhaps you're studying abroad or have moved to a completely new country;
Perhaps you're simply at home browsing YouTube and find intriguing foreign videos.

We hope TransGull becomes your go-to companion for overcoming language barriers wherever you go.","Features Overview:<br>1.

Install “Translator for WhatsApp”
Tap the floating “Translate” button on any conversation.
Select the language your friend speaks.
Every message you send and receive will automatically be translated into either your language or the language your friend speaks.
Note: This app utilizes Android's AccessibilityService API to access WhatsApp messages. We do not store your messages on our servers.

✅ Features

Automatic…once it’s enabled, no manual effort is needed to activate the WhatsApp Chat Translator
Send messages in any language (Over 100 Languages — Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Portuguese, Japanese, Russian, etc. supported).
🕵️‍♀️ Who’s it for?
